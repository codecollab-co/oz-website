    q: "Is Oz really free?",
    a: "Yes. Oz is free and fully open-source. There's no paid tier, no account, and no telemetry by default. Star us on GitHub if it saves you time.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need an account or sign-up?",
    a: "No. ProductDownload, install, run. Bring your own keys for cloud providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) or skip them entirely and run local models via LM Studio.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which AI models are supported?",
    a: "All major providers - OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, Cerebras, xAI, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Plus full local support through LM Studio and other OpenAI-compatible local runtimes.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do local models work?",
    a: "Point Oz at a running LM Studio (or any OpenAI-compatible local server), pick a model, and you're done. Inference stays on your machine - your code, prompts, and diffs never leave the box.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is my code sent anywhere?",
    a: "Only to the provider you explicitly configure. With local models, nothing leaves your machine. Oz adds zero analytics around your code or prompts.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which OSes are supported?",
    a: "macOS (Apple Silicon / Intel), Linux (AppImage / .deb / .rpm), and Windows (x86_64 NSIS installer) are all available today.",
  },
  {
    q: "Where do I report bugs or request features?",
    a: "Open an issue on GitHub at github.com/crynta/oz-ai - we read everything.",
